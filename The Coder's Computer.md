So, you think you might want to try coding. Well, lemme tell you a little about what I learned in my first class today. 
First of all, to communicate with a computer, you will need to learn the its language. There are various iterations of code that are used for different things.
The basics of code start with learning Hyper-Text Markup Language, or HTML. There is a variation of this language that is used in the GitHub environment, called Markdown.
When you use either of these languages, you must use .html or .md so that the computer can understand what you've typed.

Of course, this is only the content of a webpage. The real fun starts when you get to start programming so that the website becomes interactive, and can do all sorts of cool things.

I think the most important thing that I learned today is that if I really want to learn this new language, I can! With a little perserverance and a lot of coffee, I can succeed!
