# Revisions and the Cloud
Making revisions to files can be hard to manage when there are multiple people working on the same project. Version control is a system that was created to help, by saving changes made to the files.

There are three types of version control:
1. Local
2. Centralized
3. Distributed

Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS). Git allows users to create mirror images of their folders and files to protect against loss of data. In essence, there is a collection of folders and files '''(repository)''' on a central server that can be accessed remotely, and *also* a mirror image on a local server.

DVCS allow for colllaborative work and also protects against loss of data.
Git is the most widely used DVCS. 

To create pages with Git, developers use the terminal and text editors to write and organize the code that ends up as a website. They then transfer the code to the repository, where it it stored. This code is the "DNA" of the website, and different team members can access and edit it. 

To get the code to the internet, developers literally "push" the code to the server, using Git commands in the terminal.
