## Comparison Operators
- Compare one value in script to something
- answer is T/F

**It is usually preferable to use the strict method**

### Operators
```
== is equal to
!= is not equal to 
=== strict equal to. Both data type and value are same
!== strict not equal to. Neither data type nor value are same

> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to <= same
```
## Logical operators
compare results allow the comparison of more than one *comparison operator*
```
&& both must be true or false, or else it is false
|| if either is true, it returns true
! reverses and returns opposite state
```
## Loops 
- check a condition
- if true, code will run
- if false, code exits loop

#### For loop
- runs finite number of times

### WHile loop
- runs until false returned

### Do while loop
- like while, but always runs at least once, regardless
