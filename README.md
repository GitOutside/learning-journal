## Colleen's Learning Journal for Codefellows 102
Growth mindset is the belief that a person can learn whatever they put their minds to. All that is required is
- [x] effort and 
- [x] persistance.
### Three reminders for myself to keep me in the growth mindset are:
1. I may not be able to do coding *now*, but I will at the end of 20 weeks!
2. For every mistake I make, that is just one more opportunity to learn.
3. **Every** successful coder started out just like I am, right now.
