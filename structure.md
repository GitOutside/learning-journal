HTML is a way to communicate to the computer how you want the content structured and arranged. 

The tags tell the computer whether an item is a paragraph, a header, an image, or a whole host of other items. 

When a designer is creating the layout of a webpage, they will have created a very high level visual rendering, called a wire frame. The wireframe has all the details, such as how many pixels should be surrounding all four sides of a block of text. The detail is incredible, because this is how a developer knows what to code, so that the designer's vision can come to life.

HTML is only a crude way to group data into discrete segments. CSS is another way to comminucate to the computer, but it adds all the style, making a site user friendly and visually effective.
