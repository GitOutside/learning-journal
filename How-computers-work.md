Computers all do 4 basic functions
 1. input
 2. store
 3. processing
 4. output

 Circuits store information in bits.
 A bit is one on/off binary pair

 CPU controls all chips, and is made of many small circuits 

 Binary code runs hardware

 Code is converted to binarty so hardware can understand

 Operatiing System manages all software
